Separation of concerns is the idea that each  module or layer in 
an application should only be responsible
for one thing and should not contain code that deals with other things

So, HTML only concerns with structure.  And CSS with how elements appear.
And Javascript only responsible how user interacts with page and elements
interact with other elements.
