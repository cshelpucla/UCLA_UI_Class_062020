Absolute paths contain a complete URL, which includes a protocol, 
the website's domain name and possibly a specific file, subfolder, 
or page name.

Conversely, a page relative link only includes the name of a specific 
file or page, which is relative, to the current path. If you keep 
all of your website's files in a single directory, you can establish links between pages as follows:

<a href="page2.html">Next page</a>

Site relative would include partial path in the path
