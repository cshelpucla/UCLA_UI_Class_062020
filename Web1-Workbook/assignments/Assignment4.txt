A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that
interacts with the web browser by dynamically rewriting the current 
web page with new data from the web server, 
instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages.

SPAs are faster than traditional web applications because they 
execute the logic in the web browser itself rather than on the server. 
And after the initial page load, only data is sent back and forth 
instead of the entire HTML that reduces the bandwidth
