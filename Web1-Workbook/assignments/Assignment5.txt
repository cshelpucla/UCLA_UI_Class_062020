Web Designer - a visual designer and is generally focused on design. 
They're not usually involved in the implementation of the design, 
but they might know light HTML and CSS so they can communicate 
their ideas more effectively to the front-end developers.

Front End Developer -  The front end refers to the “client-side” 
interfaces a user sees in a website or software/mobile application. 
A front-end web developer is responsible for the look, feel and user
experience of the application. Typically, websites created by front-end 
developers don’t need to interact with information stored in a database 
to be functional. 

Back End Developer - Back-end web developers work on the server-side 
of a software application — all the infrastructure that the user 
doesn’t see but which enables them to accomplish tasks in an 
application. This type of web developer is most focused on site 
responsiveness and speed, and monitoring site functionality is their 
number one responsibility. Typically, a backend web developer oversees 
a server, application and a database.
