# Web 1 Workbook
This repo provides a template for your Course Workbook which houses all of your work for the course. This will not only keep you organized, but will be what you publish each week for review and grading purposes.

## Assignments
All homework assignments that are not related to the Final Project goes here.

## Lessons
Most of our work will be in the `spa-in-class` folder, but when we need to explore a topic we will use the Lessons folder.

## My Final Project Repo
All of your final project related files should go in this Separate Git Managed Repo folder. 

You will be:

* Publishing to git separately on a weekly basis
* Publishing to heroku during the final weeks for final submission.

## Single Page App (SPA)
We will use this folder session by session to build a SPA that fulfills on 80% of the requirements for your Final Project.
